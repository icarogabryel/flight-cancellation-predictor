# Flight Cancellation Predictor

This project is a machine learning model that predicts flight cancellations based on various features such as weather conditions, flight delays, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide airlines and passengers with insights into potential cancellations, allowing for better planning and decision-making.

## Datasets

It was used datasets of flights and weather to create merged datasets. The flights dataset was obtained from ANAC (Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil) and contains information about flights in Brazil of 2024, including flight numbers, departure and arrival airports, and flight times. The weather dataset was obtained from INMET (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia) and contains information about weather conditions in Brazil in 2024, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation. The merged datasets that was created by combining the flights and weather datasets and additional features such as the day of the week and holidays. This dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or irrelevant data.
